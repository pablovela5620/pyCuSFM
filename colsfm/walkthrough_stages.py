"""What a walkthrough stage *is*, and the palette every panel draws it with.

The vocabulary layer of `colsfm.walkthrough`: one `StageCard` per pipeline stage
holding the prose that never changes between runs, the `WalkthroughStage` that
pairs a card with its timeline index and entity root, and the constants — entity
paths, timelines, colours, relative radii — that keep eight panels and a
blueprint drawing the same recording rather than eight of their own.

Every radius here is a *fraction* of the scene's diagonal, because the
walkthrough draws scenes of very different size in one recording: Galileo sweeps
0.66 m and RoboCap walks 124 m, and a metre-fixed radius makes one an unreadable
blob and the other invisible.
