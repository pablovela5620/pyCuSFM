"""A stage-by-stage Rerun walkthrough of the `colsfm` architecture.

```
pixi run -e colsfm python -m colsfm.walkthrough \
    --input-dir data/r2b_galileo \
    --config-dir data/cusfm_configs/loop-closure-fixed \
    --output data/bench/galileo_walkthrough.rrd
```

The module is an **observer** of `colsfm.pipeline.run_pipeline`, never a second
runner: `run_walkthrough` calls `run_pipeline` with a `WalkthroughObserver`, and
the observer is handed each stage's typed result once that stage's timing window
has closed. One sequencer therefore resolves the options, times the stages into
`runtime.csv` and writes `summary.json`; the walkthrough only draws. A run under
the walkthrough leaves exactly the artifacts `python -m colsfm run` leaves, and a
new stage or backend is added in one place.

Each stage's real intermediate data lands in one recording on a `stage` sequence
timeline. Scrubbing that timeline from 1 to N walks the architecture of Figure 2
of *CuSfM: CUDA-Accelerated Structure-from-Motion* (arXiv:2510.15271):
dictionary construction → loop closure detection → pose graph optimisation on
the first row, feature extraction → feature matching on the second, camera
projection, triangulation and mapping, and extrinsic refinement on the third.

Nothing here re-implements a stage. Everything logged is read back out of the
stage results, the COLMAP database the run wrote, or the run directory the
export stage left behind, so a claim in a panel is a claim about this run.

## Where things live

| module | owns |
|---|---|
| `colsfm.walkthrough` | the CLI, `WalkthroughObserver` and the recording |
| `colsfm.walkthrough_stages` | what a stage *is*: its prose, its index, the palette |
| `colsfm.walkthrough_draw` | frusta, arcs, imagery and the notes document |
| `colsfm.walkthrough_panels` | one `log_*` per stage: what that stage produced |
| `colsfm.walkthrough_blueprint` | the tab-per-stage layout, sent once at the end |

## Entity layout

```

    /after/{nodes,edges}       the same after it
  /stage_07                    triangulation + bundle adjustment
    /points                    the model the mapper left behind
    /rounds/<metric>           Scalars on a `round` timeline, one point per BA round
    /round_chart/<metric>      the same numbers as a BarChart, readable on `stage`
  /stage_08                    extrinsic refinement (only with --optimize-extrinsics)
    /extrinsics/{before,after,shift}   per-camera centres and the shift arrows
  /stage_08 or /stage_09       export
    /points                    the final coloured cloud
    /rigs/rig_NN               input / colsfm / blob reference rigs (exoego layout)
    /tracks/<name>/trajectory  each run's rig trajectory
    /report                    the benchmark table
```

Two deliberate departures are worth knowing before reading the code.

1. **Everything is logged at its stage index, not statically.** A latest-at
   query on `stage` therefore shows stages 1..k at index k and nothing beyond,
   which is what makes the timeline a walkthrough rather than a switchboard.
   The one exception is the rig calibration `simplecv.log_rig_static` writes,
   which is static by construction.
2. **The rigs of the export stage carry two poses.** `log_rig_pose_stream`
   writes `world_T_rig(t)` through `rr.send_columns`, which stamps only the
   `frame_time` timeline — a chunk without a `stage` column is invisible to a
   `stage` query. The export stage therefore also logs each rig's first pose on
   the `stage` timeline, so the rig has a place to stand while the timeline
   walks the architecture, and still animates when `frame_time` is picked.
