"""What a mapping pass reports: its rounds, its closing polish and its final model.

The reporting vocabulary of `colsfm.mapping`, kept apart from the mapper for the
reason `colsfm.run_report` is kept apart from `colsfm.pipeline`: these are the
contract with a reader -- the pipeline summary, the walkthrough's charts, a
benchmark -- rather than anything the mapping loop needs to execute.

`MappingResult` computes its counters from the live reconstruction on every
access, which is exactly why a run that wants to remember them has to snapshot
them (`colsfm.run_report.MappingStats`): a later pass adjusts the same model.
