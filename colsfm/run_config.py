"""The command line as it is spelled, and the per-stage settings it resolves into.

`PipelineOptions` is an **input adapter**: twenty-one fields spanning unrelated
stages, kept exactly as `python -m colsfm run` spells them and exactly as
`summary.json` records them, so a run's provenance is the flags it was given.
`ResolvedRun` is what the stages actually take.

The two are separate because they answer different questions. The first is "what
did the caller ask for", which must never be rewritten -- the review found the
mapper switching backend by mutating it. The second is "what will each stage do",
which is decided once, up front, and validates as it goes: a `--caspar-option`
typo stops the run here rather than at the first bundle adjustment, after feature
extraction, matching and loop closure have been paid for.

`SelectionOptions` is the metadata-only third of the adapter. `python -m colsfm
stage` takes it, because keyframe and pair selection read `frames_meta.json` and
a config profile, touch no image, open no GPU and write nothing -- so asking them
for an output directory asked for a workspace nobody would fill.
