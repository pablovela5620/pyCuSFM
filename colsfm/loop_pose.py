"""Metric rig-to-rig relative pose for a loop candidate — the measurement, not the retrieval.

`colsfm.loop_closure` decides *which* rig frames revisit each other; this module decides
*where* one is relative to the other, in metres. It is the piece the loop-closure docstring
measured as the whole remaining problem on RoboCap: retrieval and pair selection there are
right to 39.9 mm with oracle poses, and the shipped two-view-plus-prior-scale measurement
turns that into 609.0 mm — worse than no loops at all.

The design: a local metric map, then generalized absolute pose
---------------------------------------------------------------

For a candidate rig pair `(A, B)`:

1. **Local map.** Triangulate 3-D points expressed in rig frame `A`, from the images of `A`
   itself plus its temporal neighbours `A±1..A±span`. Every ray is placed by the rig
   extrinsics and by the *local* odometry between neighbouring rig frames, which is
   accurate — the drift a loop closure removes accumulates over a session, not over 100 ms.
2. **Generalized PnP.** Feed the 2-D observations those points get in every camera of `B`
   to `pycolmap.estimate_and_refine_generalized_absolute_pose`, which solves for one rig
   pose over all cameras at once and then refines it on every inlier observation. Its
   `rig_from_world` is `B_T_A`, so the edge is its inverse.

Nothing in step 2 reads the prior relation between `A` and `B`, so the edge can contradict
the odometry about distance — which is exactly what a loop closure is for, and exactly what
scaling a two-view direction by the prior baseline cannot do.

`RigPoseEstimator` owns all of it
---------------------------------

The rig frames, the rig geometry, the keypoints, the matcher and the settings are fixed for
a whole run and are read by every step, so they are the estimator's state rather than five
arguments threaded through four functions. The object also owns the two memos that make the
stage affordable: unprojected bearings per image (one camera-model call per keypoint, which
a rig frame with twenty loop candidates would otherwise repeat twenty times) and one local
map per source rig frame, reused across all of that frame's candidates by `measure_group`.

`measure_group` is also the unit of parallelism: two source rig frames share nothing but the
read-only bearings memo, and `pycolmap.estimate_and_refine_generalized_absolute_pose`
releases the GIL, so `colsfm.loop_closure` runs one group per worker thread.

Why not the generalized essential matrix
----------------------------------------

`pycolmap.estimate_generalized_relative_pose` solves the same rig pair in one call, and
with non-zero rig baselines its scale is observable in principle. Measured on a synthetic
copy of RoboCap's rig (4 cameras, a 0.24 m span, a 0.36 m motion, a scene 10 m deep):

| keypoint noise | rotation error | recovered `||t||` (truth 0.359 m) |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0 px | 0.000 deg | 0.359 m |
| 0.2 px | 0.171 deg | **0.168 m** |
| 0.7 px | 0.084 deg | **0.217 m** |

The rotation survives; the scale does not. Metric scale in a generalized essential matrix
comes only from the rig baseline, so it is read off a 0.24 m lever arm against a scene tens
of metres deep, and half a pixel of noise halves it. Triangulating first spends the same
baseline on depth, where a redundant, refined least-squares problem averages the noise away
instead of amplifying it. The generalized essential matrix is still used, but only for its
rotation: `RigPoseConfig.max_direction_disagreement_deg` cross-checks the PnP translation
direction against it and drops a pair the two disagree about. It costs no extra matching —
it is solved from the same-camera correspondences the observation pass already read.

Depth, and why the neighbours matter
------------------------------------

RoboCap's declared stereo pair is 86 mm. A rig hop is 114 mm, so `A±1` alone more than
triples the available baseline and points it along a different axis, and the two side
cameras contribute a third view direction that the front pair never sees. Measured on the
same 488 RoboCap loop rig pairs, scored against the blob's PGO after rigid alignment
(`colsfm.loop_closure`'s docstring has the whole table):

| local map | edges | translation error vs the oracle, median | RMSE |
|---|---|---|---|
| the stereo pair alone (`neighbour_span=0`) | 189 | 197 mm | 457.0 mm |
| **plus `A±1` (the default)** | 425 | **219 mm** | **408.1 mm** |
| plus `A±2` | 448 | 231 mm | 418.5 mm |

`neighbour_span=0` measures fewer pairs because an 86 mm baseline against a scene metres
deep leaves too few landmarks to resection from: it loses 294 of the 488 pairs to the
inlier gate where the default loses 58. A second step of neighbours buys nothing and costs
one more image pair per camera in the matching stage.

What the estimator is and is not good at, measured on the blob's own 90 loop rig pairs:
its translations move decisively off the odometry and towards the blob's own measurement
(median `||t||` 132 mm against the odometry's 355 mm and the blob's 160 mm), while its
rotations agree with the odometry to 1.5 deg and with
`pycolmap.estimate_generalized_relative_pose` — an estimator that shares only the
correspondences — to **0.35 deg**. See `colsfm.loop_closure` for what that costs against a
reference whose own rotations sit 6.5 deg away.

Cross-stereo observations are unconditional
-------------------------------------------

The source rig's anchor image is matched against *both* cameras of the target's declared
stereo pair. The two cameras see the same scene 86 mm apart, so the cross pair is a real
extra observation rather than a duplicate view, and every measured configuration used it;
the switch that used to guard it was never set to False by any caller or test, so it is
gone rather than untested.

Reading a `match_fn` the caller has not matched yet
---------------------------------------------------

`colsfm.pipeline` discovers which image pairs to match by running the whole stage once with
a matcher that returns nothing, batch-matching what was asked for, then running it again
for real. So this module must ask for **every** pair it could use *before* it gates on
anything: a pair requested only after a successful gate would never be matched in
production. `test_every_needed_image_pair_is_requested_even_when_nothing_matches` pins that.
