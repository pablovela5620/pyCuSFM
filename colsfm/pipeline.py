The contract mirrors `pycusfm.cusfm_runner.CusfmRunner`: the same `--input-dir`
holding `frames_meta.json` and the images it names, the same output directory
layout (`pycusfm/constants.py`), and the same `runtime.csv` — two columns,
`command,runtime_seconds` — so a colsfm run and a blob run compare row by row.
The `command` column holds the stage name rather than a blob command line;
nothing reads it as a command, and the stage name is what a benchmark table wants.

## Where things live

| module | owns |
|---|---|
| `colsfm.pipeline` | `PipelineObserver` and `run_pipeline`, the one runner |
| `colsfm.run_config` | `PipelineOptions`, `SelectionOptions`, `ResolvedRun` |
| `colsfm.run_lifecycle` | the stage ledger, the workspace and the publication boundary |
| `colsfm.run_report` | `PipelineSummary`, `MappingStats`, `LoopEdgeRecord` |
| `colsfm.stages` | one `run_*_stage` function per stage, and their results |

## One function per stage

Each stage is a `run_<stage>_stage` function taking what it needs and returning a
small result dataclass; `run_pipeline` only composes them and times each with
`timed_stage`. The stage functions carry no timing and write no `runtime.csv`
row, so a caller that wants to step through a dataset one stage at a time — the
Rerun walkthrough, `run_stage`, a notebook — reuses exactly the code the full run
executes rather than a parallel copy of it.

Ordering notes worth knowing before reading the code:

* **Pair selection cannot see loop pairs.** Stage 3 emits the consecutive and
  stereo pairs from the metadata alone (`colsfm.pairs`); loop pairs only exist
  after retrieval and verification in stage 5, which matches them into the same
  database. `colsfm.mapping.load_correspondences` reads *every* verified
  two-view geometry, so a loop pair matched in stage 5 reaches the triangulator
  without being named in stage 3's list.
* **Loop closure needs matches to verify, and matching is a batch operation.**
  The estimator pulls matches through an injected `match_fn` one pair at a time,
  and running COLMAP's matcher per pair would reload the LightGlue graph per
  call. So the stage plans first: `colsfm.loop_closure.plan_loop_search` does the
  retrieval half of the funnel — which reads no match at all — and names the
  image pairs the measurement will ask for; one batch
  `colsfm.matching.match_pairs` fills in whichever of them the database does not
  already hold; `verify_loop_plan` then measures and gates the plan, reading the
  matches back. Presence decides what to match, not count: a pair stage 4
  matched and found nothing in is finished work.
* **`--optimize-extrinsics` maps once, not twice.** On by default. The camera-referenced
  reconstruction is built up front when the flag is set, stage 7 maps it, and
  stage 7b refines the extrinsics of the model stage 7 left behind. Both
  references give the same `cam_T_world`, so nothing about stage 7's result
  depends on which one was used (`colsfm.reconstruction`).
* **The two ONNX stages have three backends each.** `--features-backend` and
  `--matching-backend` pick between RaCo-ALIKED and LightGlue+ on their own
  engines (`colsfm.features_raco`, `colsfm.matching_raco`, the default since
  NOTES.md decision 17), COLMAP's own ALIKED and LightGlue, and the blob's graphs
  on the blob's TensorRT engines (`colsfm.features_trt`, `colsfm.matching_trt`).
  They are independent, every combination runs, and the choice is invisible past
  the database: all write the same keypoint and descriptor columns and leave the
  same matches and two-view geometries. The `pycolmap` matcher is the only one
  that cannot see a per-match score, so it is the only one that substitutes a grid
  subsample for the blob's real SSC spatial NMS.
* **`--use-gpu` governs the ONNX stages only.** ALIKED and LightGlue run on the
  GPU; the Ceres solves stay on the CPU by default, as the blob's own
  `keypoints_mapper_main` and `pose_graph_main` do (docs/open-pipeline-plan.md,
  "Facts that shape the design"). It is read by the `pycolmap` backends only —
  the two engine-backed ones run on CUDA device 0 or not at all. `--ba-use-gpu` moves the
  bundle-adjustment linear solve onto the GPU; measured it buys nothing on Galileo (1.68 s against
  1.60 s) and about 8 % on 800 RoboCap images (19.2 s against 20.9 s), so the
  default stays where the blob is.
* **Threads are not the blob's `--num_thread 1`.** That flag counts worker
  *processes*, and the runner starts one per camera; COLMAP is one process, so
  `--num-threads` defaults to -1 (every core) for extraction and matching, and
  Ceres takes the config's 8 unless `--ba-num-threads` says otherwise.

class PipelineObserver:

    The one seam a viewer, a notebook or a report needs to watch a run without

    *after* its timing window has closed, so nothing an observer does lands in
    `runtime.csv`; `stage_scope` is the only hook inside the window, and exists
    because the stage functions print their counters rather than returning them.

    Two ordering guarantees the visualisation depends on:

    * `on_reconstruction` runs before stage 7b starts, so an observer that wants
      the un-refined model sees it before the refinement mutates it in place.
    * `on_export` runs after `run_export_stage` has written every artifact, so a
