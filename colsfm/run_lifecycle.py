"""One run's stages, its ledger and the boundary at which its artifacts become real.

A cuSFM run used to update its destination in place. `run_pipeline` deleted
`runtime.csv` and left everything else; `create_database` deleted the previous
database before building its replacement; the export and the summary then
overwrote whatever was there, file by file. A run that failed halfway therefore
left the destination holding *some* of this run's artifacts and *some* of the
last one's, with nothing on disk saying so — and `colsfm.benchmark` checked that
the files existed, not that they came from one run.

Three things fix that, and they live here:

* **One ledger.** `StageLedger` is the only record of what ran and how long it
  took. `runtime.csv` is its rows written out as they complete, and
  `PipelineSummary.stage_seconds` is the same rows at the end. A stage that
  raises records nothing, because the ledger is evidence of what *completed*.
* **A staging workspace.** `open_workspace` gives the run a private directory
  beside its destination and every stage writes there — the database included,
  since the run's own options are rebased onto it. Nothing in the destination
  changes while the run is in progress.
* **A publication boundary.** `RunWorkspace.publish` marks the state succeeded
  and swaps the staging directory into place with `os.replace`, so the
  destination goes from the previous run to this one without ever holding a
  mixture. A run that fails marks its staging directory `failed` and leaves it
  for inspection; the destination still holds the last run that worked, whole.

The published layout is byte-for-byte what a `pycusfm.cusfm_runner` run leaves,
plus `summary.json` and `run_state.json`. Readers that care whether a directory
is a finished colsfm run read the latter (`colsfm.benchmark.read_run`); a blob
reference run has neither file and is accepted as it always was.
