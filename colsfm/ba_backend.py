"""Which bundle-adjustment backend a run gets, and what this build's CASPAR can do.

One owner for a policy that used to be spread over three files: `colsfm.pipeline`
parsed the `--caspar-option` strings after feature extraction, matching and loop
closure had already run; `colsfm.mapping` collapsed a probe error into "this
camera model is unsupported", let an empty support set bypass the camera guard,
and switched backend at solve time by rewriting the options object the caller
handed it. Nothing wrote down which backend actually ran, or why.

The module answers three questions, in order:

1. **What can this build do?** `detect_caspar_capability` probes it — there is no
   pycolmap call that lists CASPAR's camera adapters, so the only way to know is
   to hand it a sixteen-point problem per model and read `num_residuals`. The
   answer is a `CasparCapability`, which distinguishes *unavailable* (pycolmap
   built without `CASPAR_ENABLED`) from *probe failure* (the build has CASPAR but
   the probe could not run, e.g. no GPU answered) from *available*, and carries
   the models it projects. The three used to be one empty `frozenset`.
2. **What did the caller ask for?** `parse_caspar_options` turns
   `--caspar-option name=value` into a validated `CasparOptions`, rejecting an
   unknown name and rejecting `solver_iter_max=2.9` rather than truncating it to
   2 the way the old `int(...)` cast did.
3. **What will actually run?** `resolve_ba_plan` folds the two together into a
   `BaExecutionPlan`: the requested backend, the effective one, the reason for any
   fallback, the validated solver overrides and whether a Ceres polish closes the
   run. It is computed once, before a run writes anything, and the effective
   backend and the reason reach `summary.json`.

The fallbacks themselves are unchanged and deliberate. CASPAR *silently drops*
the observations of a camera model it has no adapter for, and *throws* when asked
to refine `sensor_from_rig`; both make Ceres take the solve, loudly. A build
without CASPAR is only discovered when a solve is attempted, so that fallback
still happens inside `colsfm.mapping` — but it now names itself in the plan the
run reports rather than only on stdout.
