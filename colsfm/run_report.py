"""What a finished run says about itself: `summary.json` and `loop_edges.json`.

The reporting layer. `PipelineSummary` is the run's own account of what it
produced and how long each stage took, written once at the end from the stage
ledger; `MappingStats` freezes the reconstruction counters at that moment,
because `MappingResult` computes them from a live model that later passes adjust.
`LoopEdgeRecord` is a pose-graph loop constraint flattened to plain numbers, so a
viewer can draw the loops without pycolmap.

Separate from the runner because these are the *contract with a reader* -- a
benchmark, a viewer, a report -- rather than anything the run needs to execute.
