"""Where the uncommitted model graphs live, and what to run when they are not there.

`data/cusfm_models/` is gitignored: the RaCo graphs are exported, not shipped, and
the engines built from them are specific to one TensorRT version and one GPU
architecture. A fresh clone therefore has none of it — and since 2026-09-06 the
default run asks for RaCo-ALIKED and LightGlue+ (NOTES.md decision 17), so "none of
it" is the first thing a fresh clone hits.

The pipeline **stops** there rather than falling back to `pycolmap`. A silent
fallback would be the one failure mode worth avoiding: every number a run reports —
keypoints, matches, reprojection, ATE — moves with the extractor, so a run that
quietly changed backend would be a different experiment wearing the same name. The
message names both ways out: build the graphs, or ask for the ablation.

The path constants live here rather than beside the code that runs them because
naming a file has no business importing TensorRT: `colsfm.features_raco` and
`colsfm.matching_raco` both pull in `colsfm.tensorrt_runtime`, which imports
`tensorrt` and `cuda.bindings` at module scope, and `colsfm.run_config` has to be
able to check for a missing graph without any of that.
