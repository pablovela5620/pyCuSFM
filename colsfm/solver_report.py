"""The one reader of Ceres' brief report, and the only shape its numbers take.

`pycolmap.BundleAdjustmentSummary` exposes `termination_type`, `num_residuals`
and `is_solution_usable` as attributes, but the iteration count and the two
costs appear *only* inside the one-line string `brief_report()` returns. Every
caller that wants them therefore has to parse text, and until this module
existed the mapper and `tools/audit/caspar_polish.py` each carried their own
copy of the regular expression — together with the same misreading of a failed
parse as `0` iterations at `0.0` cost.

That fallback is wrong in a way that matters: CASPAR's backend writes no Ceres
line at all, so "the report did not parse" is the normal outcome on that path,
and a zero-cost solve is a perfectly plausible-looking number for a report to
carry. `SolverReport` keeps unavailable statistics as `None`, so a reader can
tell "the solver did not say" from "the solver said zero".

The module deliberately imports nothing beyond the standard library: it takes
the report *text*, not a `BundleAdjustmentSummary`, so that it costs no
pycolmap import and can be exercised without a solver.
