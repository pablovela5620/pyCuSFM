"""Which rig pairs are worth measuring, decided from retrieval alone.

The retrieval half of the loop funnel, and the half that reads no match at all:
a query per keyframe of an allowed camera, the score gate, the time gate, the
same-rig gate, one hit per `|dt|` band per query, then one hit per unordered rig
pair. `colsfm.loop_closure.plan_loop_search` is its only caller, and the fact
that none of this needs a match is exactly why the pipeline's discovery run --
which learned the pair list by *executing* the whole search against a matcher
that returned nothing -- was unnecessary.

The blob applies the time gate AFTER retrieval, so temporal neighbours eat slots
out of its top-20 and it needs an early abort when more than half the hits are
too close (spec §6.4). `RetrievalIndex.search` applies it inside the ranking walk
instead, which keeps all `top_k` slots useful and reports what the gate dropped
from the same walk.
