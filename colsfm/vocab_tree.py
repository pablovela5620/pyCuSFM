"""Hierarchical k-means vocabulary and the DBoW2 L1 all-pairs score.

This is the `vocab` backend of `colsfm.retrieval`, split out because it is a self-contained
library — train a tree on a descriptor sample, assign every descriptor to a word, encode
each image as an L1-normalised TF-IDF row and score every pair through the inverted index.
`colsfm.retrieval` owns the choice of backend, the `RetrievalIndex` and the calibration of
the score; nothing here reads a database, a camera or a rig. The `Descriptors` and
`SimilarityMatrix` aliases are declared here, at the bottom of the dependency, and
re-exported by `colsfm.retrieval` for its callers.

The measured shape of the tree, why it is not the blob's `k = 9, depth = 7`, and why the
descriptors are not subsampled on this path, are all recorded in `colsfm.retrieval`'s module
docstring, next to the recall tables the decisions were made from.
