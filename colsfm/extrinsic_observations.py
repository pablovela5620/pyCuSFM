"""The observation graph of an extrinsic refinement: who saw what, and where.

Split out of `colsfm.extrinsic_refinement` because this half of the problem answers a
different question from the rest of the stage. The refinement alternates a pyceres solve
with pycolmap's bundle adjustment; bundle adjustment moves rig poses and 3D points but
adds and removes no observation, so which image saw which point never changes and is
indexed once (`build_observation_index`), while only the geometry is folded in again per
round (`camera_observations`). This module owns that separation, and nothing about the
Ceres problem the observations feed.

## What the blob's relative-block count means, measured

`co_observed_camera_pairs` reproduces the blob's `camera rig extrinsic constraint` set.
Its **777 relative blocks** on Galileo are *not* `4 declared stereo pairs x N frames`:
Galileo's 226 keyframes fall into 29 rig frames holding 8, 8, ..., 6 and 4 cameras, and

```
sum over rig frames of C(cameras in that frame, 2) = 27*28 + 15 + 6 = 777
```

exactly. So the constraint is added for **every unordered pair of cameras that fired in
the same rig frame**, once per rig frame. Because a rig's extrinsics are shared across
frames, all the blocks of one pair carry an identical residual, which is why this module
returns pairs with multiplicities rather than a block per frame; `colsfm.extrinsic_costs`
turns the multiplicity back into the blob's cost.
