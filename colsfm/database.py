"""The COLMAP database that carries cuSFM's frames into pycolmap.

`create_database` writes the four tables COLMAP's own feature extractor and
matcher expect to find already populated — cameras, rig, frames, images — using
cuSFM's identifiers verbatim (`camera_params_id` -> `camera_id`,
`KeyframeMetaData.id` -> `image_id`, `synced_sample_id` -> `frame_id`), the same
mapping `colsfm.reconstruction` uses.

Three things about COLMAP 4.2 shape this module:

* **Everything is `write_*`, not `add_*`.** pycolmap 0.x's `Database.add_camera`
  and friends do not exist (pycolmap-capabilities.md §4).
* **`Camera.has_prior_focal_length` defaults to False**, and that silently
  selects the uncalibrated (fundamental-matrix) path in two-view geometry: a
  PINHOLE pair comes back `UNCALIBRATED`, an `OPENCV_FISHEYE` pair comes back
  `DEGENERATE` with zero inliers (§5). `colsfm.cameras.colmap_camera` sets it
  True on every camera it builds, which is every camera that reaches this module.
* **`extract_features` reuses a pre-existing image row** rather than inserting a
  second one: COLMAP's `ImageReader` looks the name up first, keeps the
  `camera_id`, `image_id` and `frame_id` already stored, and leaves the rig and
  frame tables untouched. That is what lets the pipeline own the identifiers and
  still use COLMAP's own ALIKED extractor. Measured on Galileo; the log line
  `Focal Length: 852.92px (Prior)` is the visible confirmation.

Keypoints written by COLMAP are Nx6 (xy plus a 2x2 affine block), so
`read_keypoints` slices the two columns the rest of the pipeline wants.
