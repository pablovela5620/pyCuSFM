"""Triangulation and global bundle adjustment: the `keypoints_mapper_main` replacement.

Implements `docs/spec/keypoints_mapper_main.md` §5.3-§5.6 (the triangulate /
merge / complete / filter / BA outer loop) and §6 (the bundle adjustment) on
pycolmap's `IncrementalTriangulator`, `ObservationManager` and
`create_default_bundle_adjuster`, against a reconstruction built by
`colsfm.reconstruction.build_reconstruction` and a COLMAP database written by
the feature and matching stages.

```

Poses are a **prior, not an initialisation**: every rig frame is registered
before the first triangulation, and only bundle adjustment moves them.

## What is deliberately not reproduced

Two cuSFM behaviours are known defects and are left out (§9.5):

1. **Unweighted constant-frame residuals.** cuSFM whitens every reprojection
   residual by `1/sigma` except the ones observing the gauge keyframe, whose
   functor has no weight member — 13 of 6276 blocks in Galileo. COLMAP applies
   one weighting uniformly and there is no way to ask for the inconsistency.
2. **The 3-D depth residual** (`VehicleCameraReprojectionCost3D`) for keypoints
   carrying depth. pycolmap's bundle adjuster is 2-D only, and Galileo sets
   `keypoint_feature_has_depth: false`.

## Extrinsic refinement is real but unregularised

`optimize_extrinsics` needs a **camera-referenced** rig; on the default
vehicle-referenced one COLMAP freezes every `sensor_from_rig` and the refinement
is a silent no-op, so `run_mapping` raises instead (see `colsfm.reconstruction`).
Given one, it does refine: a 20 mm perturbation of a Galileo camera comes back to
0.70 mm.

What it cannot reproduce is cuSFM's **regularisation**. The blob's refinement
pass adds absolute-extrinsic priors (the paper's Eq. 14, one block per camera)
and relative-extrinsic constraints between cameras (Eq. 6, 777 blocks on
Galileo), both with sigmas from `vision_mapping_config.pb.txt` (§7).
`pycolmap.BundleAdjustmentOptions` exposes neither, and the Ceres problem
`create_default_bundle_adjuster` builds cannot be extended from standalone
pyceres (the pybind11 registry split, pycolmap-capabilities.md §8). colsfm
therefore optimises reprojection alone, and on Galileo that trades trajectory
accuracy for pixels: 0.861 px against 1.334 px, but 5.70 mm ATE against 4.33 mm,
with extrinsics moving up to 234 mm where the blob moves 11 mm. Only a stereo
pair's own relative extrinsic is well determined by a 0.66 m sweep. NOTES.md
deviation 9 carries the table.

So this path is the *ablation*, reached by `--no-regularised-extrinsics`. A default
run refines its extrinsics too — `--optimize-extrinsics` is on — but through
`colsfm.extrinsic_refinement`, which carries the priors and calls this module only
with `optimize_extrinsics` False.

## Overrides forced on pycolmap, and why

| Setting | pycolmap default | Here | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IncrementalTriangulatorOptions.min_angle` | 1.5 | `min_triangulation_deg` (2.0) | config §3.1 |
| `merge_max_reproj_error`, `complete_max_reproj_error` | 4.0 | the round's gate `g_k` | cuSFM merges and completes under the same decaying gate (§5.4, §5.6) |
| `ignore_two_view_tracks` | True | `min_correspondences > 2` | `min_correspondences: 3` drops two-view tracks |
| `random_seed` | -1 | `random_seed` (1) | determinism |
| `refine_focal_length` | True | False | `--optimize_intrinsics=false` |
| `refine_extra_params` | True | False | same |
| `refine_principal_point` | False | False | same; already off |
| `refine_sensor_from_rig` | True | `MappingOptions.optimize_extrinsics` (False) | `--optimize_extrinsics=false`; needs a camera-referenced rig, see below |
| `ceres.loss_function_type` | TRIVIAL | `loss_type` (CAUCHY) | config §3.2 |
| `ceres.loss_function_scale` | 1.0 | `sigma * loss_function_scale` (4.0) | see below |
| `ceres.auto_select_solver_type` | True | False | otherwise the explicit solver choice is ignored |
| `solver_options.linear_solver_type` | SPARSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY | `MAPPING_LINEAR_SOLVER` (SPARSE_SCHUR) | cuSFM: SPARSE_SCHUR on CPU, SPARSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY on the cuDSS path (§6.5) |
| `solver_options.max_num_iterations` | 100 | 200 | config §3.2 |
| `solver_options.max_linear_solver_iterations` | 200 | 100 | config §3.2 |
| `solver_options.num_threads` | -1 | `num_threads` (8) | config §3.2 |
| `solver_options.function_tolerance` | **0.0** | 1e-6 | cuSFM leaves Ceres' defaults; pycolmap overrides them |
| `solver_options.gradient_tolerance` | **1e-4** | 1e-10 | same |
| `solver_options.parameter_tolerance` | **0.0** | 1e-8 | same |

**The loss scale carries the whitening.** cuSFM divides the 2-vector
reprojection residual by `reprojection_error_standard_deviation = 4.0 px` and
then applies `CauchyLoss(1.0)`. COLMAP does not whiten. `CauchyLoss(a)` is
`a^2 log(1 + s/a^2)` in the squared residual `s`, so evaluating it at `s/sigma^2`
with `a = 1` equals evaluating it at `s` with `a = sigma`, up to the constant
factor `sigma^2` that cannot move the minimum. The port therefore sets
`loss_function_scale = sigma * loss_function_scale = 4.0` (§9.2).

## What §9.3 promises that pycolmap cannot deliver

`IncrementalTriangulatorOptions` has **no** RANSAC block and no residual-type
switch: `ransac.max_error`, `confidence`, `max_num_trials`, `min_inlier_ratio`
and `TriangulationResidualType.REPROJECTION_ERROR` live on
`EstimateTriangulationOptions`, which only the standalone
`pycolmap.estimate_triangulation` takes. Driving the triangulator therefore
means accepting COLMAP's own angular create/continue thresholds (2.0 deg) and
enforcing the pixel gate `g_k` where it is reachable: on merging, on completion
and on the per-round filter. Deriving the create threshold from the gate through
the focal length (`atan(g_k / f)`) was tried and moves nothing: 2035 points
against 2035, 1.6706 px against 1.6706.

## Measured against the blob, on the blob's own matches

| | Galileo 32 keyframes | Galileo 226 keyframes |
|---|---|---|
| images with observations | 28 vs 28 | 224 vs 224 |
| points | 2035 vs 1275 | 14 496 vs 5065 |
| mean reprojection | 1.671 vs 1.699 px | 1.415 vs 1.550 px |
| worst rig-pose difference | 1.26 mm / 0.118 deg | 2.55 mm / 0.092 deg |
| the blob's own pose correction | 11.27 mm / 0.569 deg | 12.66 mm / 0.364 deg |
| runtime | 0.9 vs 1.1 s | 8.0 vs 6.7 s |

The point count is the one figure that does not match. cuSFM grows **one**
disjoint track per connected component of the match graph and triangulates it
with plain MSAC — no local optimisation, no final refit — so it rejects roughly
half its candidate tracks. COLMAP's LO-RANSAC keeps them. The result is a
superset at a lower reprojection error: 98-99 % of the blob's points have one of
ours within 5 cm, and merging is already at a fixed point (a second
`merge_all_tracks` pass returns 0), so the difference is structural rather than
a missing merge.

## `ba_backend = "caspar"`: COLMAP's GPU bundle adjustment

`MappingOptions.ba_backend` picks the solver behind the same
`create_default_bundle_adjuster` call. `caspar` needs a `CASPAR_ENABLED` build,
which only the `colsfm-caspar` environment has (`docs/caspar-build.md`); the
stock environment raises when the adjuster is built and this module falls back to
Ceres and says so, so the flag is safe to pass anywhere.

**CASPAR drops the robust loss.** It solves plain least squares whatever
`ceres.loss_function_type` says, so the CAUCHY term at sigma 4 that whitens
cuSFM's residual (§9.2, the table above) is simply not applied: every outlier
enters the normal equations at full weight. What still rejects them is the outer
loop — the per-round gate `g_k` filters at 25, 20, 15, 10, 5 px *before* each
solve, and `filter_degenerate_points` / `filter_projection_failures` run after it.
That is enough: an ablation on KITTI 06 — Ceres with `loss_type: TRIVIAL` — scores
0.899 m Sim(3) ATE against the robust run's 0.895 m, so the loss is not what
CASPAR's 1.299 m costs (NOTES.md "CASPAR backend"). Its float32 arithmetic is.

Three more constraints, all from COLMAP 4.2.0's source and all handled here:
observations from a camera model the build has no adapter for are *silently
skipped*, so `resolve_ba_backend` falls back to Ceres rather than solve a
quietly smaller problem. Which models those are is a property of the build, not
of CASPAR — stock ships PINHOLE and SIMPLE_RADIAL, `colsfm-caspar-fisheye` adds
OPENCV_FISHEYE (`docs/caspar-fisheye-adapter.md`) — and no pycolmap call lists
them, so `caspar_supported_camera_models` measures them with one tiny solve per
model. `refine_sensor_from_rig = True` is a hard throw on a
multi-sensor frame, so `optimize_extrinsics` falls back too (the regularised
`colsfm.extrinsic_refinement` path keeps CASPAR: it holds the extrinsics fixed
inside the pycolmap solve by construction); and `refine_focal_length` must equal
`refine_extra_params`, which it does — both are False.
