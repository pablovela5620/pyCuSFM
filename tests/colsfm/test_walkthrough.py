"""The stage-by-stage Rerun walkthrough, checked by reading a saved `.rrd` back.

The seam is `colsfm.walkthrough.run_walkthrough`: one config in, one `.rrd` out
plus a cuSFM-layout workspace on disk. Every assertion goes through
`rerun.experimental.RrdReader`, so what is checked is what landed in the file,
not what the logging calls were handed. The expected entity paths are written
out as literals rather than imported from the module under test — importing them
would make each assertion agree with the code by construction.

The run uses the stock `feature_extractor_main` distance gate (0.5 m), which
keeps 34 of Galileo's 226 keyframes: the same smoke-sized selection
`test_pipeline` uses, and enough for every stage to produce real data.

NOTES.md gotcha 9 applies here as it does in `test_rerun_log`: chunk record
batches carry **bare** component names, so column lookups are unprefixed.
