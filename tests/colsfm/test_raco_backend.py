"""The `raco` feature and matching backends: batched RaCo-ALIKED and LightGlue+.

**Two halves, gated differently.** The first half is pure contracts — the
normalisation round trip between extractor and matcher, the size grid, the
profile bounds, the engine-selection rule, the batch-size guard. None of them
loads an engine or reads a weight, so none of them is gated on one. They used to
be, by a module-level `pytestmark`, which meant a fresh clone — where
`data/cusfm_models/` is gitignored and therefore empty — ran none of this and
reported it as skipped.

The second half really does need the graphs and the GPU, and carries
`requires_raco_models`. Rebuild the graphs with `pixi run -e raco raco-export`
and `pixi run -e raco raco-export --batched-extractor-path
data/cusfm_models/raco-aliked-b1-16.onnx`.

The bands are the blob's own Galileo statistics again (feature_matcher_main.md
§6): 2048 keypoints per keyframe, median 430 verified matches per pair. RaCo is
a *different* extractor, so this asserts that it lands in the same neighbourhood
rather than on the same number — that is the "near-parity" claim, and a band is
what near-parity means.

The one timing claim — that the fixed engine beats the shape-dynamic one at the
top of its profile, which is why `select_raco_engine` has an `auto` rule at all —
is marked `perf` and skipped unless asked for; see `tests/colsfm/conftest.py`.
