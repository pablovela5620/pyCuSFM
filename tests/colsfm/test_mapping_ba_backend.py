"""Which bundle adjuster a mapping run gets, and the Ceres polish that ends it.

The policy `test_ba_backend.py` states as a pure contract, observed here where it
is actually applied: `bundle_adjustment_options` reading a real
`pycolmap.Reconstruction`, and `run_mapping` finishing a run on whatever backend
survived the pre-flight. That needs a rig, a database and a CASPAR build to be
present or absent, which is why it is not in the pure-contract file — and why it
is not in `test_mapping.py` either, whose subject is the map rather than the solver.

Covered here: the three CASPAR fallbacks (camera model, extrinsics refinement, a
build without CASPAR_ENABLED), the capability probe, the solver-option cast, and
the single Ceres bundle adjustment that finishes a CASPAR run.
